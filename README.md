# Air-Quality-Prediction

This project explores and predicts Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning models. The dataset is analyzed, visualized, cleaned, and used to train regression models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) with hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data visualization (pairplot, heatmap, boxplot)
- Regression modeling (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)
- Model evaluation (MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ²)
- Model saving and loading

## Getting Started

### Requirements
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
1. Download the dataset from KaggleHub as shown in the notebook.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook in the `Notebook` folder:
```bash
jupyter notebook air-quality-prediction.ipynb
```
3. Follow the notebook cells for data exploration, modeling, and evaluation.
